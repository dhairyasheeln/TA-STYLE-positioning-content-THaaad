                        <p>Everyday, everyone shows up. We learn, build, teach, discuss, and make progress on the software side of things.
                        We keep the learning intense.
                        We care utmost about it.</p>
                        <h3>Make friends</h3>
                        <p>Internally, we say this often - Skills are the second best thing students will develop here. The best will be friendships.
                        These friends, later in life, can be your co-founders, co-workers, at the least they will form the core of your professional network.</p>
                        <h3>Play</h3>
                        <p>We do things that everyone wants to - play sports, run, sweat, meditate, exercise, yoga. You know, healthy things.
                        Every goal/run you score is a shipped project. Lead an active lifestyle.</p>
